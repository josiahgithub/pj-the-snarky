# pj-the-snarky
An ai to talk to the list chat. I want to train this to add flavor and humor to the list gm. 


Overall Goals 
Primary:
- make targeted list references
- Make fun of people
- respond to commands

Secondary:
- Dark humor joke repository
- respond to people with a targeted list entry
- Dial up or adjust response frequency

Bonus Round:
- Post memes
- Be able to accept loaded in content
- consultant for list entries?

True daily double:
- Conversational with some degree of sarcasm


Core functionalities to get working that are foundational to everything. 
- Chatbot, it has to respond to some degree
- The gm interface (input and output)
- Trigger logic (what will the Ai respond to?)
- Determine what responses for what (Counters? unprompted statements? analysis?)
- Ability to access list data
