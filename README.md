An ai to talk to the list chat. I want to train this to add flavor and humor to the list gm in the style of a famous person. 

There will be a few inputs, with the main parameter being the person or style wanted. 

The bot will track frequency, and then riff on it if a certain frequency of messages is hit. It will also include a context section
